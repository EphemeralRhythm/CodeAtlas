### Competitive Programming Roadmap

Code atlas provides a comprehensive roadmap with a variety of tracks, designed to teach complex concepts in a fun and digestible way.
Users select the track and topic they are interested in, and the application starts by explaining the concepts,
then it will quiz the users in the content that they learned.

Users get penalized for wrong answers and rewarded for correct answers. For every wrong answer, the user loses a live.
When the number of lives hits 0, the user will need to wait for their lives to regenerate before they could
resume their learning.

After completing the lessons, the users get a summary of their performance indicating that they completed the level,
and they will be able to access the next level in the current track.
